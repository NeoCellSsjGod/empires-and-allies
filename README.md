> Empires and Allies(Facebook) officially closed June 17th, 2013

In the absence of a repository collecting game files and information, I've created this one hoping to be able to play again this wonderful game.\
So, I'm trying to rebuild the 2011-13 version of Empires and Allies.
Feel free to join and make your own contributions. Our actual objectives are [here](#project).

> A good way to start is saving all the icons from the copy done by Wikia still accessible [here](http://empiresandallies.wikia.com/wiki/Empires_%26_Allies_Wiki/Main_2).

*Zynga continues to expand way beyond the farms that made it famous. On Tuesday, the San Francisco-based social gaming company announced the launch of its first strategy combat game, Empires & Allies.*

*Empires & Allies is the first title to come out of the Los Angeles development studio Zynga opened last year. The game will launch internationally in 12 different languages on Wednesday, June 1.*

*In a press release, Empires & Allies‘ executive producer Amer Ajami said the game incorporates the social mechanics that have defined Zynga’s super popular, if less bellicose, titles. “Empires & Allies is strategy combat gone social – think CityVille meets Risk,” the press release quotes Ajami as saying. “We’re focused on bringing our players a new form of entertainment, and a strategy game is definitely a new playground for us.”*
