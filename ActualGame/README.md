## Actual Game
Here we have the actual game flash file (.swf).\
Download index.html and game.swf in the same folder. You may need the Adobe Flash Player browser plug-in to run it.
Alternatively you can download a [Flash player Projector](https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html)  to run the .swf file without the HTML file.
